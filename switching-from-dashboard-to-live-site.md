# Switching from Dashboard to live site

The Dashboard controls the backend of your project site. It’s what you see when you initially login to WordPress. As you work, you’ll need to switch back and forth between the Dashboard and the live site.

To switch between the Dashboard and the live site:

1. Click the project site name in the upper-left corner.
2. Choose Dashboard or Visit site \(whichever one you want to use.\)
