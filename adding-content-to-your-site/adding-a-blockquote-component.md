# Adding a quote component

A blockquote is a design element that highlights an interesting quote within your story. A blockquote does not replace the original quote in the text of your story. Rather, it serves as aesthetic element that reiterates the importance of the quote.

An example of a quote component can be found in [this story](http://longform2016.mediamilwaukee.com/against-the-academic-odds/).

1. In your Post, select the Text tab to add work in the [Text editor](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/wordpress-aesop-story-engine-basics/content/adding-content-to-your-site/working-with-content-in-the-text-editor.html). 
2. In the [Text editor](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/wordpress-aesop-story-engine-basics/content/adding-content-to-your-site/working-with-content-in-the-text-editor.html), position the cursor where you would like the blockquote to appear.
3. Click the Add Component button. The Aesop Story Engine component interface will appear. 
4. In the Aesop Story Engine interface, click Quote.
5. Make the following changes in the Aesop Story Engine interface:

| Parameter | Change to |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quote Styles | Pull Quote |
| Component Width | 760px |
| Quote Size | Start with 3. You may need to experiment with the size \(see below.\) |
| Quote Text | Add quote text here. Note: Do not add quotation marks. |
| Cite | If you would like to site the source of the quote in the blockquote, add the source's name here. Note: This is optional. |
| Reveal Effect | In Place |

1. When finished, click Insert Component. The component's shortcode will appear in the Text editor. 
2. In the Publish section of your Post, click Update.

## Adjusting quote size

1. In your Post, make sure the [Text editor](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/wordpress-aesop-story-engine-basics/content/adding-content-to-your-site/working-with-content-in-the-text-editor.html) is active.
2. Find the shortcode for your blockquote. The shortcode will start with `[aesop_quote`. 
3. In the shortcode, find the `size` parameter. Change the size to a new number between 1 and 10. Note: Do not delete the `" "` around the number. 
4. In the Publish section of your Post, click Update. Preview your changes. Make further adjustments as needed.
