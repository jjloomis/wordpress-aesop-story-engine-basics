# Adding a Featured Image to your Post

A Featured Image is the "hero image" that appears at the top of your story. 

The Featured image is also the image that appears in the grid of stories on the project site.

Note: Featured Images must be landscape-oriented images.

1. In your Post, scroll down to the Featured Image area (on right.)
2. Click `Set featured image`. (You may need to click the downward-pointing arrow to expand this area.)
3. In the Featured Image dialog box, use the Upload tab to navigate to and select an image on your computer. Or, use the Media Library tab to select an image that was previously added to your site.
4. Click Set featured image.
5. When finished, click Update or Publish.
