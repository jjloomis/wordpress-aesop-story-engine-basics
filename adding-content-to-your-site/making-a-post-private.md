# Making a Post private

As you work on your project, you may want to keep your Post private until you're done working on it. You (and your instructor) will be able to work with and preview your project when it is set to private. However, it will not be publicly visible on the internet. 

To make your Post private:

1. In your Post, go to the Publish area (upper right) and click the Edit link next to Visibility: Public.
2. Click the Private radio button. Then click OK.
3. When finished, click Update.
